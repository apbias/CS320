REFLECTION

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensured my code was of quality and functional by utilizing unit and white-box testing to validate all components and paths. I made sure my code aligned with the requirements of the project by developing clear tests that would validate the results. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Requirements analysis and ongoing feedback through communication will help translate the needs of the users into fuctional and non-functional requirements. With CI/CD and the feedback of the users, expectations can be met rapidly and helps ensure the program mets user needs while also having a great user experience (Which we test at the last stage).

How do I approach designing software?
Planning and thorough analysis requirements will help get the project off on the right foot. Continously testing and identify bugs will minimize technical dept and strengthen the effeciency at which the project is developed. Using the right testing tools and CI/CD will ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. I will also refine the design through feedback and testing, ensuring it meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
